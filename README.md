# DAA Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains all source code related to the Analysis of the different Sorting Algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Quick Sort, using:

  - First element as pivot
  - Random element as pivot
  - Median of first, middle and last elements as pivot

### Part I: Direct Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

There are two python scripts: [single_sort_test](single_sort_test.py), [all_sort_test](all_sort_test.py)

[single_sort_test](single_sort_test.py):

- Provides option to test running time of a single sorting algorithm manually
- Can choose between sorting you own array, a random array, increasing array, or decreasing array
- You can also choose one sorting algorithm, of you choice
- NOTE: Choose array sizes greater than 500, otherwise time will be too small!

[single_sort_test](single_sort_test.py):

- Provides option to test running time of all sorting algorithms, for a single array
- Can choose between sorting you own array, a random array, increasing array, or decreasing array
- Times of the sorting algorithms will be given as output
- NOTE: Choose array sizes greater than 500, otherwise time will be too small!
